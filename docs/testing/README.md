# Testing Murmurations Services

This directory contains guides and other information about testing in Murmurations Services.

We use a combination of unit and [end-to-end tests](/docs/testing/run-e2e-tests-locally.md) to ensure code quality. We have also created basic [load tests](/docs/testing/load-testing.md) to measure performance.
