# The reflex.conf file is used with the reflex tool, which is a command-line
# tool for running commands when files change. The -r flag specifies a regular
# expression to match files, and the -R flag specifies a regular expression to
# exclude files. In this case, the regular expression -R '_test\.go$' excludes
# files with a _test.go suffix.

# When a file with a .go extension is modified, the go run ./cmd/validation
# command is executed. This command compiles and runs the validation service in
# the cmd directory of the project.

-r '\.go' -R '_test\.go$' -s go run ./cmd/validation
